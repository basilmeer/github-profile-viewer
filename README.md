React app, let's you search for Github users and displays related summarized info. [Demo here](https://react-github-profile-viewer.netlify.com/).

## What This Uses
* React.js
* AJAX

## To-do
- [ ] Change the layout a bit
- [ ] Set up auto suggest
- [ ] Change the AJAX calls to Promises
- [ ] Add lazy loading
- [ ] Add a way to return to the last search if it fails

## How to setup

### Installation
To set up the dependencies, either run:
```sh
$ npm install
```
Or if you've got Yarn, then:
```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Starting the server
To boot up Webpack's development server, run:
```sh
$ npm run dev:watch
```

### Build
For a deployment build, run:
```sh
$ npm run build
```
The app creates a build in the `app/` directory which can be used to deploy the app to a hosting of your choosing.

## Developer Note
This app is by no means meant to do something amazing or extraordinary; it's here as proof of my progress as I work my way through React.js until I'm good enough at it to call myself a React.js Developer.

I'll be coming back to this project time and time again to add improvements and change up the way I did things before. Cheers! :wave:
