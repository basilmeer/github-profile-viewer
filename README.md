# Github Profile Viewer
React app, let's you search for Github users and displays related summarized info

## Requirements
* npm
* webpack-dev-server (best if you have it installed globally)
* A text editor (Atom, Sublime, Code)
* A stable internet connection

## How to setup
Run the following commands in your cmd or terminal to set things up
```sh
npm install
```
After that's done, make sure you've got webpack-dev-server installed though in case you don't:
```sh
npm i webpack-dev-server -g
```
All that's left is to run the development server and you're good to go
```sh
webpack-dev-server
```

Go to `localhost:8080/app` and feel free to test it out.
